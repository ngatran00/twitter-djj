# twitter-djj

- The model is trained on the tweets from the official account of POTUS and their personal account at the time of being the president against the DJJ value on the day the tweets were posted.
- The model is trained with GloVe.
- The model is overfitting, which could be due to the small number of data (~17k data points), or the parameters for the model are not tuned.
